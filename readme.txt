# QVMC

Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC) Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for implementing and experimenting with Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (QVMC) methods. QVMC is a computational technique used to estimate ground state energies and properties of quantum systems using variational principles and Monte Carlo sampling.

## Innards

- `helium_analytical`: Optimization of a 4-parameter (analtyical) helium model, achieving results within 0.003 au of the true energy (David, Carl W. "Compact Singlet S Helium Wave functions (corrected)." (2006).). Implementation of Metropolis sampling, analytical gradients and energy expressions and optimization using ADAM.
- `nn_helium`: Initial implementation of a neural network ansatz for the helium atom

## Getting Started

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Parvfect/QVMC.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script or explore the notebooks for examples.
